# Half-Plane Range Reporting

This is a project for my COMP 150 class (Algorithms with Data Structures). I chose this project because it is a geometric use case for fractional cascading. This method of computing the intersection of a half-plane and a point set is output sensitive and allows for very efficient queries after a fairly efficient preprocessing step.
